Hi I'm Heiner, welcome to my scientific website!

I am a PhD student working on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at the Empirical Inference Department of the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://ei.is.mpg.de/person/hkremer), where I am advised by Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf. I hold a Master's degree in mathematics from the University of Cambridge and a Bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Frankfurt.

My current research interest is focussed on developing statistical methods to learn from conditional moment restrictions, a problem formulation which arises in many fields ranging from causal inference (e.g. instrumental variable regression) over economics to reinforcement learning and generally robust machine learning. In this context I am mostly working on empirical likelihood methods and distributionally robust optimization.
Previously I have worked on epidemiological modelling, computational image analysis and computer-generated holography. Please visit my [research page](/research/) for details.
