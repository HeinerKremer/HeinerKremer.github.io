I am a PhD student in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at the Empirical Inference Department of the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://ei.is.mpg.de/person/hkremer), where I am advised by Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf. I hold a Master's degree in mathematics from the University of Cambridge and a Bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Frankfurt.

Currently my research interest is focussed on distributionally robust optimization and method of moments estimation for causal inference.
Previously I have worked on epidemiological modelling, computational image analysis and computer-generated holography.
